# Markov Model Bot for Discord
Simple markov bot that can predict a user assuming enough data is collected.

# Installation
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* create a .env file with the following
    * API_KEY
    * TARGET_ID
    * ADMIN_ID (optional but remove line in code, also won't be able to retrieve messages)
    * TEXTFILE_PATH

! ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE A TEXT FILE AT THE LOCATION YOU ARE WRITING TO FOR DATA !

Once that is done just run the bot.py file and you're good to go.
